## 📖 About The Project
As a university student, managing time was my biggest struggle — assignments piling up, exams to prepare for, and zero work-life balance. I tried every productivity app out there, but none of them clicked.
**So I built my own.**
RoutineApp is the time management solution I wish I had from day one. Built with React Native and AI-assisted development.
